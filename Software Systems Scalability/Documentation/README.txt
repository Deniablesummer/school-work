Placeholder for project documentation.

DayTrading Inc. requires a complete set of documentation to be delivered at the end of the project in
addition to the working prototype.
• Full documentation of architecture including complete analysis of design choices.
• Full documentation of test plans, testing results, and test analyses.
• Full documentation of work effort required to build prototype, including weekly individual log
book entries signed by each member of the design team.
• Complete capacity planning and transaction time documentation, including experimental
results and extrapolations.
• Full security analysis.
• Full project planning and execution documentation for prototype development ef-fort.
• Full analysis of system capacity and capacity planning documentation.
All claims within the project documentation must be supported through appropriate experimental
testing and analysis
All documents must be clear, concise, and correct with respect to English usage and grammar.
Documentation that is not comprehensible, overly verbose, rambling, etc. will be viewed by
DayTrading Inc. as indicative of the design team’s general level of care and attention, and there-fore
will reflect negatively on the team’s overall evaluation.
